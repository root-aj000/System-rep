📁 1. Project Setup & Planning

✅ Tasks:

[ ] Define zones and layout of 10-acre land (1 acre/zone)

[ ] Finalize hardware components (sensors, solenoids, Pi, relays)

[ ] Create Git repository with modular folder structure

[ ] Prepare BOM (Bill of Materials) for procurement

[ ] Decide on cloud/local hosting for Django app



---

🧱 2. Backend Development (Django + DRF)

📂 Models

[ ] Zone, Valve, Sensor, Motor, FertilizerTank

[ ] IrrigationSchedule, FertigationSchedule

[ ] SensorReading, MotorStatus, Alert

[ ] Inventory, UserProfile, CropProfile


📂 API Endpoints

[ ] POST sensor readings from Raspberry Pi

[ ] GET status for dashboard (zones, valves, pressure, inventory)

[ ] POST commands to Raspberry Pi (e.g., open valve)

[ ] CRUD for inventory/fertilizer entries

[ ] User login/authentication with JWT


📂 Celery + Redis Tasks

[ ] Schedule irrigation/fertigation jobs

[ ] Retry logic for failed MQTT or REST posts

[ ] Daily/weekly summary reports generation

[ ] Alert generation based on thresholds



---

🖥️ 3. Frontend Dashboard (Django Templates / React)

📊 Dashboard View

[ ] Acre-wise zone cards with:

[ ] Moisture %

[ ] Valve state (open/closed)

[ ] Next/last irrigation & fertigation

[ ] Motor pressure indicator


[ ] System overview bar: Motor ON/OFF, pressure, weather forecast

[ ] Alert panel (sensor fault, low fertilizer, overwatering)

[ ] Graphs for:

[ ] Moisture trend

[ ] Fertilizer usage

[ ] Flow and pressure



🧰 Admin Views

[ ] Create/edit fertigation recipes

[ ] Upload crop calendars

[ ] Schedule irrigation/fertilization

[ ] Set threshold rules for alerts



---

🧠 4. Edge Control (Raspberry Pi Python Script)

🛠️ Sensor Integration

[ ] Read from:

[ ] Soil Moisture

[ ] Temperature (soil + ambient)

[ ] Flow meter

[ ] Pressure sensor

[ ] Load cell (fertilizer tank)

[ ] EC/pH sensors (optional)


[ ] Send data via MQTT/REST


🕹️ Actuation Logic

[ ] GPIO-based solenoid control

[ ] Motor on/off with relay

[ ] Fertilizer injection control

[ ] Feedback: read solenoid states (if sensors available)


🔄 Communication

[ ] Subscribe to command topic via MQTT

[ ] REST polling fallback

[ ] Handle command execution + confirmation


🔁 Local Failover

[ ] Local rule-based irrigation trigger (if offline)

[ ] Data caching & backsync to server

[ ] Watchdog for self-restart



---

⚙️ 5. MQTT Broker & Messaging Design

[ ] Setup Mosquitto broker (cloud or local)

[ ] Design topics:

sensor/zoneX/moisture

command/zoneX/valve

status/motor/pressure


[ ] Message structure: JSON with timestamp, value, source

[ ] MQTT ACLs for security

[ ] Integrate MQTT in Django using paho-mqtt or channels



---

📦 6. Inventory & Fertilizer Management

[ ] Fertilizer tanks monitoring via load cell

[ ] CRUD: add/remove fertilizer stock

[ ] Alert if quantity falls below threshold

[ ] Link recipes to crop profiles

[ ] Fertigation plan generator per crop stage



---

🔐 7. User Management & Security

[ ] JWT-based login/auth (admin/operator/viewer roles)

[ ] Password reset, 2FA (optional)

[ ] API rate limiting

[ ] HTTPS via Nginx + Let’s Encrypt



---

🌈 8. Optional Advanced Features (Highly Recommended)

📡 Weather-Aware Irrigation

[ ] Integrate OpenWeather API

[ ] Skip watering if rain is forecasted

[ ] Adjust irrigation duration by temperature


📉 ML-Based Irrigation Planning

[ ] Train model on historical soil moisture + weather + irrigation data

[ ] Use scikit-learn or TensorFlow Lite on Pi


📸 Camera & Vision

[ ] Attach RPi Camera

[ ] Capture crop images periodically

[ ] Detect stress or disease (future phase)



---

📊 9. Reporting & Analytics

[ ] Export CSV or Excel reports (monthly)

[ ] Compare zone-wise water and fertilizer usage

[ ] Report anomalies (e.g., uneven moisture, faulty valves)

[ ] Mobile-friendly dashboard



---

🚀 10. Deployment & DevOps

[ ] Dockerize Django, Redis, Celery, Mosquitto

[ ] Setup Nginx as reverse proxy

[ ] Configure systemd for Pi script

[ ] Automatic backup (local + cloud)

[ ] OTA updates to Raspberry Pi from Django backend



---

🧪 11. Testing

[ ] Unit tests for models and APIs

[ ] Integration tests with MQTT + Pi

[ ] Simulate sensor failures

[ ] Load test: 10 zones updating per minute

[ ] Field trial with partial deployment (2-3 zones)



---

📘 12. Documentation

[ ] User Manual for dashboard usage

[ ] Admin Manual for system operations

[ ] Developer Guide for codebase + deployment

[ ] Maintenance SOPs for hardware calibration

[ ] Fertilizer guide by crop type
