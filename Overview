🔧 System Overview

🎯 Goals:

Automate irrigation and fertigation for 10 acres

Provide precision control and monitoring via a web dashboard

Ensure scalability, modularity, and adaptability to different crops/seasons



---

✅ Core Features (Your List + Enhanced Recommendations)

🌾 Sensor Monitoring (per-acre or per-zone):

Soil moisture (%)

Soil temperature

Ambient temperature & humidity

Solar radiation (optional)

Rain detection (for irrigation suppression)

pH and EC of irrigation water (critical for fertigation)

Real-time pressure (pump and pipe level)

Water flow meters (to track consumption)


💧 Irrigation Control:

Status of main motor (on/off, pressure in bar)

Per-acre solenoid valve state (open/closed)

Manual override option

Last and next irrigation timestamps

Irrigation based on:

Sensor thresholds

Crop calendar

Rain forecast integration (API)



🌿 Fertigation System:

Fertilizer tank levels (kg or %)

Precision fertilizer dosing by weight (load cell integration)

Last 3 fertilizations and next 2 (scheduled)

Status of 10 dedicated solenoid valves for fertilizer injection

EC/pH correction logic

Mixing tank agitation controls (if used)


📦 Inventory Management:

Stock of NPK fertilizers (kg or %)

Threshold alerts for low stock

Purchase history / usage logs

Monthly reports


📊 Dashboard Views (Django):

Acre-wise view with color indicators (Moisture, Valve state, etc.)

Timeline charts: watering/fertigation schedule

Sensor graphs (real-time & historical)

Alert panel (leak detection, sensor failure, etc.)

System logs


⚙️ System Control:

Raspberry Pi GPIO control for relays/valves

MQTT communication for real-time updates

Over-the-air (OTA) firmware update feature

Safe shutdown/restart options

Logging (local + cloud backup)


🔐 Admin Tools:

User role management (viewer, operator, admin)

API access control for remote apps

Alert configuration panel (SMS/email integration)



---

🧠 Advanced / Future-Proof Features:

AI-based irrigation scheduling using ML models

Crop-specific fertigation recipes

Weather forecast integration (OpenWeather API or similar)

Field image processing (for disease/stress detection)

Predictive maintenance on pumps and sensors

Mobile app with push notifications

Power consumption monitoring



---

🧱 Backend (Django + Raspberry Pi)

Django App Structure Suggestions:

dashboard – web UI views

api – REST API (DRF) for frontend and RPi

sensors – models and views for sensor data

control – hardware control logic via GPIO/MQTT

inventory – fertilizer/chemical tracking

alerts – threshold checks and alerting
