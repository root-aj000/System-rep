üåê PHASE 1: REQUIREMENT GATHERING & SYSTEM ANALYSIS

‚úÖ Goals:

Automate irrigation & fertigation

Display full control/status on a web dashboard

Monitor soil, weather, and water parameters

Inventory & nutrient management


üîç Deliverables:

Use-case document

Crop requirements matrix (fertigation schedule, water needs)

System diagram (sensor zones, valve layout, etc.)

BOM (Bill of Materials) for hardware



---

üèóÔ∏è PHASE 2: SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN

A. Hardware Architecture

Zones: Divide 10 acres into 10 zones (1 acre/zone)

Raspberry Pi(s): Central controller + GPIO extensions (MCP3008 or I2C expanders)

Sensors:

Soil Moisture (per zone)

Soil Temperature

Ambient Temp & Humidity

Pressure Sensor (Motor)

Flow Meter

Load Cell (for fertilizer precision dosing)

pH/EC sensors (optional)


Actuators:

Solenoid Valves (10 irrigation + 10 fertigation)

Relay control of motor pump



B. Software Stack

Component	Tech Stack

Backend	Django, DRF, PostgreSQL, Celery
Frontend	Django Templates / React
Data Viz	Plotly.js, Chart.js
Communication	MQTT (Mosquitto), REST
Edge Interface	Python on Raspberry Pi
Storage	PostgreSQL
Scheduling	Celery + Redis
Deployment	Docker, Nginx, Gunicorn



---

üß± PHASE 3: BACKEND DEVELOPMENT (DJANGO)

1. Data Models (models.py)

SensorReading, Valve, Zone, IrrigationSchedule, FertigationSchedule, Inventory, MotorStatus, Alert, UserProfile, etc.


2. API Development (DRF)

Endpoints for:

Zone status

Sensor data (POST/GET)

Manual override

Inventory CRUD

Fertigation recipe management

Alert handling


JWT Auth (for frontend and devices)


3. Task Scheduling

Celery tasks for:

Triggering irrigation/fertigation

Checking sensor thresholds

Generating alerts

Inventory notifications

Auto-report generation



4. MQTT Integration

Subscribe to topics:

sensor/zone1/moisture

status/valve/zone3


Publish commands:

cmd/valve/zone2/open

cmd/motor/on




---

üß† PHASE 4: EDGE DEVICE DEVELOPMENT (RASPBERRY PI)

1. GPIO and Sensor Handling

Use gpiozero, RPi.GPIO, and I2C/ADC libraries

Store readings locally in SQLite for retry

Schedule using cron or python schedule


2. Communication Logic

MQTT Publisher for real-time sensor data

REST API fallback for updates

Command listener via MQTT subscriber


3. Fail-Safe Features

Local mode if backend is down

Hardware watchdog for system reboot

Battery/UPS monitoring (optional)



---

üñ•Ô∏è PHASE 5: FRONTEND DASHBOARD

1. User Interface Features

Dashboard: Per-acre view of sensors & valves

Timeline: Fertigation/Irrigation history

Graphs: Moisture trend, EC trend, pressure

Controls: Manual override (valve/motor)

Inventory: Stock level, usage chart, reorder alerts


2. Admin Features

Fertilizer recipe manager (kg, time, EC target)

Crop calendar scheduler

Role-based access


3. Real-Time Updates

WebSockets (Django Channels) or periodic AJAX

Live valve state and motor pressure



---

üì¶ PHASE 6: DEPLOYMENT & SCALING

1. Dockerize Services

Django app

Redis

PostgreSQL

Mosquitto (MQTT broker)


2. Cloud/Edge Hosting

Host Django backend on AWS EC2 / local NUC

Local Raspberry Pi as edge computing unit


3. Reverse Proxy

Nginx with HTTPS (Certbot + Let‚Äôs Encrypt)


4. Monitoring Tools

Prometheus + Grafana

Logrotate for Raspberry Pi

Auto-backup to cloud



---

üß™ PHASE 7: TESTING & QA

1. Unit Tests

Django models, API, MQTT bridges


2. Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing

Simulate sensors/valves using mocks

Fault injection: sensor failure, valve stuck


3. Performance Testing

Concurrent sensor publishing

Multi-user dashboard simulation



---

üìä PHASE 8: POST-LAUNCH & MAINTENANCE

1. Analytics

Monthly reports: water/fertilizer usage

Zone-wise performance tracking


2. Alerts

SMS/Email/Telegram notification for:

Low inventory

High EC

Motor failure



3. OTA Updates

Push Raspberry Pi script updates from Django admin

Versioning system for field scripts



---

üìò DOCUMENTATION PLAN

User Manual: How to use dashboard

Developer Guide: API docs (Swagger), deployment steps

Maintenance Docs: Sensor calibration, OTA updates

Farming Guides: Crop water/fertilizer schedule templates
